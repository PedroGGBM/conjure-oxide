language Essence 1.4

letting V be domain variant { a : bool, b : int(0,4) }

find x : V
such that x[a] = true

find y1, y2 : V
such that y1 = variant { a = false }
such that y2 = variant { b = 4 }

find z : V
such that x = z

find t1, t2 : V
find someInt : int(0)
such that t1 = variant { b = someInt }
such that t2 = variant { b = t1[b] }
