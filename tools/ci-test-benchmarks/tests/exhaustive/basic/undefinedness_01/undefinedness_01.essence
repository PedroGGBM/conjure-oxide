letting m be [1;int(1)]
letting n be [true;int(1)]

find x,y,z : bool

such that x = (m[0] = 1)
$ here m[0] is undefined
$ which makes 1=m[0] false (not undefined, undefined bool == false)
$ which makes x = false

such that y = (n[0] = true)
$ here n[0] is undefined, hence false
$ true = false is false
$ y = false

such that z = (n[0] = false)
$ here n[0] is undefined, hence false
$ false = false is true
$ z = true
